# TheCyclistProject
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! This was my first unguided data project and also the first time I used GitHub. This project formed a part of final course work for Google's Data Analysis Professional Certificate on Coursera. This work gave me an opportunity to apply the key techniques learned throughout the course into some real world data with real set of challenges.

## Project Background
For this project I played the role of a junior data analyst at a bike share company called Cyclistic. The company had determined that annual membership holders were more profitable than casual riders. They wanted to launch a marketing campaign targeting casual riders in order to persuade more of them to become annual members. As a part of this, my work was to analyse the differences between how casual riders and annual members used the different types of bikes available and to provide key insights that might determine their marketing strategy.

## My Approach
I adopted the six step data analysis process that I learned in the course. 

- **Ask**: Identifying the major business questions
- **Prepare**: Collecting the data and identifying how itâ€™s organized.
- **Process**: Stage of performing the cleaning checks before diving into analysis
- **Analyze**: Organizing and formatting the data, aggregating, performing calculations and identifying trends and relationships.
- **Share**: Presenting the findings with effective visualization.
- **Act**: Sharing the final conclusion and the recommendations.

As for the tool of analysis, I used R programming language for cleaning, manipulation and vizualisations. 

## What was the ASK? 
I began with an intention to explore the data along the lines of a few broad questions:
1. How is the usage by casual riders and annual members on different days of the week? Is there any significant difference?
2. How is the usage throughout the year? Do particular months show increased usage by one group over the other?
3. How the usage differs by different times of day?
4. What are geographical hotspots of usage? How the two groups pan out geographically?
5. Are particular start stations more popular with one group over the other?
6. Of the different types of bikes available for use, do annual members use a different type of bike to casual members?
