This first plot shows that in 2024 the company in its customer base had 63% of members and 37% casual riders. 37% is still a very broad customer base to tap on and this reinforces the company's idea that the key to long term success and stability would be to convert even more the causal riders into full annual membership.

### 2. Count of rides by months

For both types of customers, the busiest month was September and the slowest month was January.
Bike demand reduces considerably in the colder months of Chicago i.e. in Nov, Dec, Jan and Feb
The hotter months period from May-Early October provides the bulk of the sales.
One thing to note is that for members demand still persists in October but there is a sharp decline in demand by casual riders. What this suggests is while members use the bikes throughtout the bikeable season in Chicago because of the work, the casuals mainly use the bikes during the months of June-September mostly for recreation.

For members, the busiest weekdays were Monday through Friday suggesting the bike usage for commuting to offices or schools. The numbers decline somewhat during the weekend with the lowest usage on Sunday. Note the usage of bikes by members from Monday-Friday is more than double the usage by casual riders. 
For casual riders on the other hand, the busiest days were Saturday and Sunday suggesting the usage of bikes for weekend recreation.

### 4. Duration of rides through the week

The average duration of a ride for causal members is substantially higher than members, in fact, almost double every day of the week.

The busiest time of the day for both members and casual riders was after lunch, peaking around 5 pm for both. There is also a sharp uptick for members in the morning between 7-9 am. This strongly suggests that members are mostly using the bikes for commuting purposes, for example to office or schools.

In a nutshell,
How Members differ from Casual riders is that they ride more during the week but for short durations
How causals differ from members is that they ride more during the weekend and on an average ride for longer duration every day of the week.
Similarity between the two is: both ride more in summers while ride demand fall in winters. Also both have similar start and return times.
